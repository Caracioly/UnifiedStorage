# Unified Storage v1.1.4

## What's new
- Added support for `ItemDrawers Mod` integration in Unified Storage.
- Unified storage scanning now recognizes and handles drawer storage sources when the mod is present.
- Integration is optional and runtime-safe: behavior remains unchanged when `ItemDrawers` is not installed.
