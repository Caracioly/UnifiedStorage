# Unified Storage v1.1.5

## What's new
- Improved `ItemDrawers` discovery and runtime integration through `API.ClientSideV2` reflection (`kg_ItemDrawers`), while keeping safe fallback behavior when the mod is not installed.
- Improved mixed-source scanning so drawers and vanilla containers are aggregated together and sorted consistently by distance/source.
- Improved drawer source handling for read/deposit/withdraw flows via dedicated `DrawerStorageSource` implementation.
- Improved deposit routing by honoring drawer priority when an item already matches the drawer content.
- Added global scan cap config (`MaxContainersScanned`, default `128`) to control large-base scans with both containers and drawers.

## Notes
- `ItemDrawers` support is optional: Unified Storage behavior remains unchanged when `kg_ItemDrawers` is absent.
- Raising `MaxContainersScanned` too high can impact performance.
