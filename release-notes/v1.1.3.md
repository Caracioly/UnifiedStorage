# Unified Storage v1.1.3

## Summary
This release improves input compatibility while searching, strengthens terminal visual identity, and simplifies end-user configuration.

## What's new
- Added an input focus compatibility patch on `Chat.HasFocus` so search typing has priority even with other input-related mods.
- Increased terminal tint visibility so the green terminal color is easier to identify in-world.
- Simplified global configuration by removing user-facing options that were internal/technical defaults.
- Moved release notes to a dedicated `release-notes/` folder and linked them from `README.md`.
